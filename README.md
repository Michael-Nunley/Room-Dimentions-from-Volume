# Room-Dimentions-from-Volume
In blocks, of course. Put in the volume and the internal height of the room you want, it'll spit out the external dimensions in x,y,z for that room.

Example: I want to know the optimal dimentions of a room with an internal volume of 100 and a max internal height of 4

```python volumeToDimentions.py 100 4```
